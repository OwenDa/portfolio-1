# World of Whippets

*World of Whippets* seeks to raise interest in, and dispell some common misconceptions about, whippets and other sighthounds as these dogs are often overlooked by would-be pet owners seeking a new companion.

## Purpose  

**Target Audience:** General public.

**Background:**  
Whippets are a dog breed which belong to the class "Sighthound". This class of dog is often used in racing and hunting (known as "coursing"), both legal and illegal. As an unfortunate side effect of their use for sport, two problems arise:  
1. Retired sighthounds and those found unfit for sport are frequently abandoned or surrendered to animal shelters. Many others are seized by animal welfare agencies if found to be mistreated.
2. The general population often associate these dog breeds with sports and do not see them as viable pets, making them difficult to rehome. Muzzling, which is a standard precaution in dog racing, creates the false impression that they are more likely to bite than other dog breeds. Their use in hunting small animals leads the general public to believe sighthounds are dangerous to small domestic animals, such as cats.  
A third problem exists for the whippet breed specifically:
3. Compared to other sighthounds, the general public is more aware of greyhounds, due to their visibility in racing and the ongoing public debate concerning its legality. Although much smaller, whippets closely resemble greyhounds, more so than any other sighhound breed and are often mistaken for greyhound puppies. Those who do not wish to adopt a greyhound may fail to consider a whippet simply because they are not aware of their existence.  
  
**Problem Statement:**  
Insufficient public awareness surrounding sighthounds and, in this case, whippets in particular, causes lower rates of adoption and significantly lengthens the rehoming process.

**Solution:**
Create a website which offers an introduction to whippets and other sighthounds, increasing public awareness. Provide positive imagery to reinforce their suitability to domestic settings and simultaneously counteract the common misconceptions which present an obstable to their adoption.

**Special Considerations:**
1. The target audience is comprised of people who are not yet entirely familiar with whippets or with sighthouds generally. In order to have arrived at the website, the user must have some degree of curiousity on the subject, but it may also be their first introduction to the existence of this breed. Therefore, the project should not overwhelm the user with unecessary information but act as a bridge between the user's curiosity and contact with animal adoption services who can provide more specific information concerning individual dogs in their care.  
2. Equally, the project should ensure that its emphasis on whippets does not diminish the user's openness to other sighthound breeds. Rather, it should aim to promote adoption for all sighthounds while raising greater public awareness about the existence of whippets.  
3. Finally, despite the distressing circumstances which cause sighthounds to require rehoming in such great numbers, the project should create a largely positive emotional response within the user, emphasising an optimistic and constructive tone.
